# NexusFX Pro

This code is a sample implementation of the NexusFX Pro forex trading robot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The robot utilizes a secure and efficient scalping technique for trading in the forex market. 

## Scalping Technique Implementation

The scalping technique implemented in this code aims to execute numerous trades within a day and profit from small price changes. The algorithm identifies small price changes and places buy orders accordingly. 

1. The current bid price is obtained using the `SymbolInfoDouble` function.
2. The target price is set as the current price plus 0.001, and the stop loss price is set as the current price minus 0.001.
3. A buy order is placed using the `OrderSend` function with the specified volume, target price, and stop loss price.
4. If the order is executed successfully, the take profit and stop loss levels are adjusted based on market conditions using the `OrderModify` function.
5. A short interval of 1 second is waited before placing the next trade.

## Risk Management System

The risk management system implemented in this code aims to protect the user's account from potential losses. It calculates the maximum loss based on the account balance and a specified risk percentage per trade. 

1. The account balance is obtained using the `AccountBalance` function.
2. The maximum loss is calculated as the account balance multiplied by the risk percentage.
3. A protective layer is implemented to safeguard trading activities.
4. A trade is placed with the specified risk percentage using the `OrderSend` function.
5. If the order is not executed successfully, error handling code is executed.
6. A short interval of 2 seconds is waited before placing the next trade.
